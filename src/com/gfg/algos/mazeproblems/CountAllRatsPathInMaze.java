/* Given a matrix of 0's and 1's. 
 * 
 * A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., 
 * maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source
 * and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.
 * 
 * In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path 
 * from source to destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. 
 * 
 * For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more 
 * complex version can be with a limited number of moves.
 *
 * Following is an example maze.
 * 
 * 			{1, 0, 0, 0}
 * 			{1, 1, 0, 1}
 * 			{0, 1, 0, 0}
 * 			{1, 1, 1, 1}
 * 
 * Solution : 
 * 			{1, 0, 0, 0}
 *			{1, 1, 0, 0}
 *			{0, 1, 0, 0}
 *			{0, 1, 1, 1}
 * 
 * All enteries in solution path are marked as 1.
 * 
 * Note : There could be more than one solution
